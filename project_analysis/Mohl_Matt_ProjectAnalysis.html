	<h1>Hunt Graphic</h1>

	<h2>Site Intent</h2>

	<p>The intent of the newly re-designed Hunt Graphic website is to increase usability and to steer people more clearly toward the main goal of order conversions. Right now HGX is using tables for their presentation as well as misplacing the primary content, making it very difficult to locate the signposts required for users to find their way to the end goal. To fix this, I am going to format their website so that it sells their brand and quality, which they do already, but not very well. Hunt Graphic prides itself on their quality, custom work and cutting edge tech (website not included), so playing on that will be a great way of getting the user’s attention. Finally, I will make customizing an order the primary call to action on the homepage, in an attempt to increase conversion to the form page.</p>

	<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

	<p>Hunt Graphic’s competition is something to be afraid of. One thing I noticed is other sites do not scare me away as soon as I navigate to the page. When visiting HGX’s website, the first thing I want to do is get off of HGX’s website, so we need to work on that obviously. Also, I tried finding HGX on Google by using their top search queries and discovered that they are actually fairly discoverable. The one problem I predict is that people will see HGX’s website and immediately think it isn’t the site they were looking for, considering it doesn’t look as professional as the other graphics websites out there.</p>

	<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>

	<p>Looking at HGX’s search queries, is see that there are two different types of users. One user knows exactly what they are looking for, including what type of decal for which brand of bike. Then there are users looking to shop. These are the people that type things like “mx decals” into the search bar to see what comes up, and when HGX comes up, it is going to need to cater to each of these users.</p>

	<p>As for the demographic of your audience, I can safely assume your targets are 18 to 35 males who live in lightly populated areas. This demographic can be broken into two sub-categories, one of users who are looking for a specific decal or design and one of users who are just generally looking to shop or even order a custom decal. The workflow of the first demographic would begin at the homepage. They could then go from there to another page where they would be able to browse decals by brand of vehicle. As for the second demographic, they could either select the main call to action on the homepage and begin customizing their own order, or they can choose to browse by brand or styles.</p>
