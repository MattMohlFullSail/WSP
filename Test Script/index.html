	<h1>Hunt Graphic Website Re-design</h1>

	<p>Welcome to the user test for the re-designed Hunt Graphic website! Their company distributes decals for extreme sport vehicles around the country. For this user test, you will be using a six page website that simulates what their full website would look and feel like.</p>

	<p>Before testing, it should be known that the new site is only six pages, which means every navigatable page will be displayed in the navigation bar. Any links on the site that do not work most likely lead to a part of the site that has not been built for the re-design. If, at all, throughout the testing you should have a question, feel free to ask me.</p>

	<p>And without further delay, here is a link to the site so you can begin testing.</p>
